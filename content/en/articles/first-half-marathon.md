A continuous stepping with left and right foot, the wind breezes alongside a little warm from rising sun, the pain along the legs to kneecap that made me felt I want to stop but I'm nearly finished this. That's my thought during my first half-marathon in my life in my hometown, Bangsaen beach, Chonburi.

### How I ended up in this run?

Actually this is not intended at first. I planned to have my first run in ATM 2025 in Bangkok with my colleagues but I just forgot to get a spot. After that, I tried finding over others runs to join and there's a glimpse in my mind.

"Why don't I get a run in my hometown?"

10 minutes later, I paid "the charity ticket" just for a donation and tax reimbursement with running as an option without any thoughts on route and difficulty. A week later I discussed with one my friend who's university athlete and he told me

K: Seriously?
Me: I already paid.

I know myself if I don't train then I'm really screwed up for sure and training arc is started.

### One more kilometers, one more run for endurance

From September I started doing a real training over running. Luckily, I already have consistent routine over weight training, bouldering-top rope climbing and did few run club weekly. I also had an on-and-off relationship with running since the city's more likely to have lots of dust and treadmill is really made me feel like a hamster.

I asked my friend over consulting and coaching on running. He taught me on primers and just got me tested over running for 10km with really consistent pace around 6.00-6.30/km. My first long run is really on that point with a bit high heart rate. The feedback is simple, "Bro, you got potential at least finish this.". After that I did easy run over treadmills on weight training days for 30 minutes and do at least a long run once to twice a week.

I started to get my distance a bit more further with longer time on feet. There's a bit stuck on some week that I got pain over ITB that I need to rest for few weeks. But overall I definitely 2 things:

- I got bored over long running really quickly. It ate up my time a lots that I want to go play something else.
- I need to do a bit more stretches and drills. This ended up a whole night of researching and add stretches and drills before running.

From all of that, I get myself at most for long run with around 13-14km and 80 minutes on feet. Which is a bit less than target which is around 15 km. I felt a bit anxious but my friend told me just to enjoy it and don't get injured.

### Pre-race at the beach

On Satruday, I arrived at Chonburi. I get my bib and have a visit at the expo to buy essentials e.g. magnet for attaching bib, electrolytes, energy gel starches. Then I hopped myself running over Bangsaen beach for testing water a bit and had a driving to scout over the route. Even I knew my hometown well, but still made me awed on what I'll do within few days. Alright, time to assemble gears, have a well sleep before run.

### Running day

Around 2AM, I just woke up, realized I woke earlier than schedule and couldn't sleep anymore. After took a bath and got myself from hotel to nearby running starting point. Many people just got themselves a warm-up run around the beach and I also got myself running slowly in the crowd.

There's 3 waves for running from elite athletes from Thailand and foreign countries to general people like us. I was in the last wave but in the first block. I tried to clear out stress at first but with its vibes and chill weather soften me. I got myself along first half peacefully with pace around 6.00/km and with a bit slower during 11-15km. The hill is a bit long slow burn during uphill and fast downhill that required some techniques. People are nice, determined and friendly. I even learned how to tackle from a guy in the suit in a very quick course in few minutes.

During section in Sammuk mountain around 15-18km, this is the short but most energy-draining one here. The route is really steep both up and down. I tried my best to slow down a bit by skipping over downhill and still got a bit pain after few kilometers down the mountain and in front of the beach. At that time, I knew exhaustion was at the gate and the only thing I had thing I need to use to finish off is my heart.

I took a few deep breathes.

I looked over the beach, people ran and gathered in the finish line.

I walked a few full steps, left-right, left, right,...

And the steps just went faster and faster. I took final blow to finish line and that's my first medal for my first half-marathon.

### A walk over food and drinks

There are a lots of foods and drinks to fill up my gut and replenish myself. I took Pad krapow with oatmeal and coffee. I walked over to my friend who ran earlier, had a chat. I also tried ice bath over legs which was really painful. Even though I'm regulars for this thing, with pain over legs took this to another level. Well, it's concluded, right?

### Post-run, thoughts during running high and what I've got

I've said this run is like mirror. It reflected me.

This run reflected efforts I took, tiredness I had, endurance and strength I have summed up. All reflected in my finishing time "02:24:41" and pace 6.40/km.

It told me softly that all you've done won't be wasted and it's already connected at first. And it's all in this pattern for works and other stuffs.

I felt myself during run that time flew so fast that pain got jaded, heart rate didn't matter anymore. When I enjoyed something, I just went with the flow and this run reflected me when I enjoyed myself.

What's next? I think my next target for me is to push myself over a shorter run but with faster time e.g. 25 km with sub 25 or 10km with sub 50. I know that this is only start of this journey. There're more runs and people to meet along the way.

Hope you enjoy this read and happy on your next run, either few steps or full marathon.
