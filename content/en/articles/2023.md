A bit late for 2023 review but here we are.

### 🏋️ Health

- I put this first because it is my "number zero" of what I'll focus. Strong body and mind will make good decision, good work and good life.
- Best decision is start "climbing", mostly indoor bouldering and a bit of top-rope climbing. It makes me learn how to control movement and fill purpose of my current fitness routine. Also climbing community is really friendly, I met dozen of new friends and familiar faces I've known before. Btw, this is [my climbing log](https://www.instagram.com/bier.on.slxb/).
- Also tried,
  - driving golf -- not hard just a bit too drilling and I just practice for socializing)
  - wakeboard -- I'm too lazy to swim back to land when I fell of to water
- From all those deed results me less office syndrome, good sleep and more energy.
- Still have a bit of short-tempered sometimes even outside I would look like a calm person.

### 💼 Work

- This is busy year of working and learning new things alongside, both technical stuff and people stuff. In technical perspective, I focused on setting up process and practices that improve quality of work.
- Know weakness in handling underperformed people, I'm pretty messed up with this. Some person even teased me that you should be "engineering trainee", I simply replied, "please, no.".
- Have doubt in career path and thought in switching role, but results in using what I can do well as "edge" to extend to new role.
- Also, switching work. Appreciate everyone who I've worked during these two years and looking forward to new challenges.

### 🧑‍🤝‍🧑 Community stuff

- This is "out of the cave" year.
- Joined as staff in creatorgarten events
  - [Bangkok Open Source Hackathon 2023](https://creatorsgarten.org/event/bangkok) as OD, running around staff and mentor
  - [sht7](https://creatorsgarten.org/event/sht7) as running around person
  - [Math at sundown](https://creatorsgarten.org/event/mathsatsundown)
- Also visited couple of events in blockchain space, reconnect with bunch of folks and update narrative.
- Start to learn Svelte via contribute to open-source project. Who don't love contributing something for public while learning stuff and building your portfolio.

### 💵 Finance

- I have a bit of lifestyle inflation, so mostly I cut my budget to mutual funds, bonds, equities. Anything that is hard to make back to cash for saving.
- Started building offshore portfolio (NASDAQ, S&P) focused on accumulate worth in long term. I think understanding business, macroeconomics, market rotation really helps in investing.
- Compared to Thai equity market, earn dividends every quarter is real blessing. You know, some earning while your portfolio goes a bit red.

### 🧑‍🤝‍🧑 Relationship

- Still single.
- A bit suffered from losing someone who guide me.
- I've reconnected with many persons in this year. I appreciated that a lot.

### 💭 What I've learned in 2023.

- Stoicism, this is really core of it.
- Preparation, resourcefulness and self-awareness is essential to be advantage in any scenarios.
- Know when to cut loose.
- Don't lose hope. There's always an opportunity or key takeaway from worse situation.
- Know how important relationship is, don't burn the bridges. It's not worth it.
- A solitude and introspective session is required to review yourself and plan your next step of life.
- And again,
  > Every transformation demands as its precondition "the ending of the world" the collapse of an old philosophy of life - Carl Jung
- Life is a burden, so choose the glorious purpose (burden).
